Dogfight Arena
==============

About
=====
This project is about simulating plane dogfights using pygame.
Players will write their bot planes as classes which will then be parsed and simulated in pygame (in animation or headless).
This is inspired by project in which I participated in at my university.

Planes
======
Planes will be written as classes in separate modules.

Plane types
-----------
Planes will be structured into several categories.
Heavy, fast, agile, damage, scout...
Each will have different stats.

plane info is referenced in google sheets
